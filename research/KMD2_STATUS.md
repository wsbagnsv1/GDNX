# KMD-2 (Fable) validation — working state

## *** MILESTONE (2026-07-06): WORKING GDN WITH MIMO + COMPACTION ***
From-scratch testbed (`research/testbed_mqar.py`, atomic-token MQAR, 16 pairs,
6000 steps × batch 32, ~5 min/run on cuda:1), suite v2 results:
  attn control        recall 0.996  (task valid)
  kmd2 r=4 NO CONV    recall 0.000  <- conv ablation = the whole failure mode
  kmd2 r=1            recall 0.996
  kmd2 r=4            recall 1.000
  kmd2 r=4 +kron keys recall 0.996
  kmd2 r=4 +compact P32 R8 / R4   recall 0.988 / 0.953  (graceful degradation)
  kmd2 r=1 +compact P32 R8        recall 1.000
TWO required ingredients found: (1) short depthwise causal conv before q/K/V —
without it the k written at the value position can't contain the key identity
(adjacent-token binding impossible; CE settles at ln16 = "any context value");
(2) a trainable regime (the frozen-Qwen CE proxy denies alignment gradients to
ANY arch — see probe chain above). gdn3/kmd2.py (Qwen drop-in) still LACKS conv;
retrofit before any heal attempt (Qwen's frozen conv1d is available to reuse).
Caveat: 16 pairs doesn't stress capacity (r=1 ≈ r=4 expected); MIMO ADVANTAGE
still unproven -> frontier sweeps below.

## FRONTIER FINDINGS (2026-07-06/07)
Frontier 1 (load/state ladder): **MIMO r=4 HURTS under memory pressure**
(np64: r1 0.977 vs r4 0.762; np32 dk16: r1 0.965 vs r4 0.473) — redundant slots
multiply cross-token interference (fable_idea §6 risk, unmitigated in v1).
Compaction P32 R4 at np64: BOTH r collapse to 0.0.
Frontier 2: (a) **slot-ortho penalty 0.1 rescues MIMO** (np64 r4: 0.762->0.922;
dk16: 0.473->0.813) — mechanism confirmed; r=1 still best on pure capacity, so
MIMO's case = throughput/multi-fact tokens, not capacity. (b) **compaction has
TWO walls**: R=32 truncation on a 32x32 state is a forward NO-OP yet recall
collapsed to 0.043 -> the `no_grad` compaction DETACHES the state every P tokens
(truncated BPTT) so cross-window WRITE gradients vanish — writes never learn.
P64 (half the detach events) > P32 at same R (0.246 vs 0.012) confirms.
**The real GDN3 kernel has the same no_grad compaction at P=16/seq 512 = 32
detach boundaries -> yet another structural reason all 41 auto-research runs
couldn't learn long-range retrieval writes.**
Frontier 3 (STE across compaction boundaries, np64, P32): **the gradient wall is
FIXED and the two walls are now cleanly separated.**
  R=32 no-op control:  no_grad 0.043 -> STE **0.949**  (proves detachment was the killer)
  R=16:                no_grad 0.012 -> STE **0.926**
  R=8:                                  STE  0.785
  R=4:                 no_grad 0.000 -> STE  0.113   (info wall: R must scale with load)
  **FULL STACK r=4 + slot_ortho 0.1 + STE + R=16: recall 0.906** <- a working GDN
  with MIMO + compaction under 4x-capacity load. GOAL ACHIEVED in the testbed.
Info-wall law at load 64: R=16 ~93%, R=8 ~79%, R=4 ~11% -> keep R >= load/4-ish.
Deployment note: STE changes ONLY training gradients; inference math is identical
to the no_grad kernel, so the trained weights drop into the production kernel.

## MAMBA-3 TRAPEZOIDAL TEST (2026-07-07) — trap does NOT replace the conv here
`--trap` = Mamba-3 exp-trapezoidal write (lam_t-blended decayed prev-write
carryover + learnable q/k channel biases; arXiv:2603.15569 Eq.5/6):
  np16 no_conv+trap: recall 0.000     np64 no_conv+trap: recall 0.000
  np64 conv+trap:    recall 0.945 (vs conv-only 0.977 — no stacking benefit)
MECHANISM: the trapezoid carryover is B_{t-1}x_{t-1} — a SAME-TOKEN outer
product (prev key (x) prev value). MQAR's key->value binding needs the CROSS
product k_{t-1} (x) v_t (key token precedes value token), which only a shift of
key info into the value position provides — i.e. the conv. Mamba-3's "obviates
the conv" claim was measured on LM perplexity, not strict adjacent-token
binding; for retrieval tasks the conv (or an explicit K-side shift/cross
carryover) remains REQUIRED. => Heal design: KEEP the conv (reuse frozen Qwen
conv1d). Optional later: a cross-carryover variant (write v_t under k_{t-1})
as a principled in-recurrence alternative.

## MAMBA-3 FINALIZATION SUITE (2026-07-07, np64, controls: r1 0.977 / ste 0.926 / r4+ortho 0.922)
  rot (rotating state transition, data-dep cumulative 2x2): 0.957  ~neutral
  rot+trap:                                                 0.973  ~neutral
  r_out=4 (output-MIMO widening):                           0.984  best np64 (weak +)
  r=4 + r_out=4 + ortho (full in+out MIMO):                 0.949  best r4; still <= r1
  rot + STE compaction R16:                                 0.953  +2.7 over ste ctrl (~2.5σ, suggestive)
ALL author ideas recall-SAFE; none required. Two weak positives under seed
replication (run_seeds.sh: seeds 1,2 for ste/rot_ste/r1/rout4). Include-rationale
should rest on primary benefits: rot -> state-tracking (+ maybe compaction
robustness); output-MIMO -> throughput at iso-state (+1.2 downstream at 1.5B in
Mamba-3); trap -> no benefit here (LM-ppl-scale claim untested by us), skip.

## NEXT (Qwen heal, in order)
1. Retrofit into gdn3/kmd2.py: short conv (reuse frozen Qwen conv1d), STE across
   its compaction (if compaction is kept), slot-ortho aux term.
2. Replace the training signal: layerwise distillation from Qwen's native
   GatedDeltaNet layers (dense signal) or aux InfoNCE alignment; CE-only frozen
   proxy is proven unable to train ANY drop-in.
3. Then A/B r=1 vs r=4+ortho at matched state in the healed model.

Goal: test whether Fable's KMD-2 idea (fable_idea.txt) gets nonzero MQAR recall on
the robust proxy (`research/proxy_mqar.py`), vs original GDN3's 0-recall ceiling.

## Setup done
- `gdn3_fable` is the self-contained sandbox. `proxy_mqar.py` ROOT repointed to it
  (was importing gdn3 from `gdn3_two_timescale_release`). Runs on `--device cuda:1`
  (GPU0 = user's other experiment). venv: `/home/dev/gdn3_qwen35_package/.venv/bin/python`.
- Branch `kmd2-fable` (off `main`).
- `gdn3/kmd2.py` = `KMD2LinearAttn`: per-token rank-r block-Householder delta
  (RLS T-factor), trainable q/k/v/gate projections, frozen Qwen output path
  (in_proj_z gate + out_proj). Selected by env `GDN3_KMD2=1` (set from config
  `"kmd2":true`). Knobs: kmd2_r/h/dk/dv/eps. Defaults H=16,dk=dv=64,r=4,eps=0.5.
  Wired in `gdn3/gdn3_upgrade.py::apply_upgrade` + proxy env mapping.
- Bug fixed: load_qwen_weights missed `in_proj_z.weight` (endswith) → gate was 0 →
  0 grad. Now 198/198 params train. Smoke: finite, ~20min/400steps, 6GB peak.

## Results
- BASELINE (original GDN3, exp001) reproduced in sandbox: tok_acc 0.2958, recall
  0.0, skip 0.0 — matches auto-research. Sandbox validated.
- `runs_fable/kmd2_001.json` (r=4, seq512, nkeys4, 400 steps): tok_acc 0.30,
  recall 0.0, skip 0.0, ce 1.71 — SAME ~0.30 plateau as GDN3. No recall.

## REVISED DIAGNOSIS (Fable, after inheriting session)
Two v1 problems found by author review; they overturn the "CE-only loss is the
structural ceiling" handoff:
1. **Memory horizon bug**: v1 decay init sigmoid(2.5)=0.924/token → ~13-token
   horizon; the queried binding (~150-200 tokens of context, shuffled placement)
   was ERASED before the query arrived. No surviving binding = no retrieval
   gradient, regardless of loss. Fixed in kmd2_002: bias 6.0 → 0.9975 (~61%
   retained over 200 tokens). Different failure cause than original GDN3 (frozen
   q/k can't align) — same 0.30 plateau from the outside.
2. **Data budget**: CE on answer tokens DOES reward exact retrieval (it's the only
   way below the format floor); the real issue is induction circuits emerge via a
   phase transition needing ~10k+ episodes (Zoology/MQAR literature). The proxy
   trains 400 episodes (batch 1, accum 1). ALL 41 auto-research runs + kmd2_001
   stopped pre-emergence. `grad_accum`+`steps` are legal config knobs to scale this.
   Fable's web 17% = a from-scratch run past the phase transition; nothing mystical.

Prediction: horizon fix + episode scale → recall emerges for KMD-2 (trainable q/k)
but NOT for original GDN3 (structurally blocked). Then r=1 vs r=4 isolates MIMO.
- kmd2_002 (horizon fix only): tok_acc 0.3208, recall 0.0, skip 0.0, ce 1.87.
  Slightly above v1 (0.30) and baseline (0.296) but no recall. Horizon fix was
  NECESSARY (restores retrieval gradient) but NOT SUFFICIENT — consistent with the
  data-phase-transition claim: gradient exists now but needs episodes to drive it.
- kmd2_003 (horizon + grad_accum 4 × steps 500 = 2000 episodes): tok_acc 0.2667,
  recall 0.0, skip 0.0. DATA-SCALE HYPOTHESIS FALSIFIED — tok_acc even dropped;
  no emergence trend across 2000 episodes.

## PROBE RESULTS (the decisive measurements, 2026-07-06)
1. `probe_kmd2_alignment.py` — trained KMD-2 (proxy recipe, 200 steps), measured
   q->k gold-vs-distractor cosine gap at answer position: **mean -0.044 across all
   18 layers, best-head ~+0.01 = NOISE. CE training produces ZERO alignment.**
2. `probe_contrastive_alignment.py` — InfoNCE-trained (Wq,Wk) probes on frozen
   hidden states, span-pooled keys: **eval 92-95% at every layer except L0
   (chance 8.3%). The representation is FINE; a solution exists in KMD-2's own
   parameter space (linear q/k projections). CE just never finds it.**
3. `probe_train_qk_init.py` — per-token keys (the recurrence's real constraint):
   eval drops to **29% mean (best layers 4/5/6/18/21/22: 40-64%)**. Key identity is
   DISTRIBUTED across the binding span, not in single tokens; overfits at 300 eps.
   Saved per-layer probes -> `runs_fable/qk_probe_init.pt`.

**MEASURED CEILING: CE-through-frozen-LM-head never CREATES q->k alignment even
though it's linearly there (95% pooled). Not arch, not horizon, not data, not
state-transition. Author's suggestions (Mamba3-style 2x2 state rotations, learned
lambda_t, trapezoidal B_{t-1}x_{t-1} carryover) address state-transition fidelity —
orthogonal to this bottleneck; revisit AFTER alignment exists.**

- kmd2_004 (probe-init: q_proj + k_slots slot-0 seeded from qk_probe_init.pt,
  otherwise identical to kmd2_002): RUNNING. Tests whether CE AMPLIFIES a
  partially-aligned init into recall or the format attractor DESTROYS it.
  Either way decisive: recall>0 => Fable's result recreated in trusted harness
  (init+config only, proxy untouched); still-0 => strongest evidence the LOSS
  must change (aux alignment loss — needs Billy's approval as a proxy edit).

## Key interpretation of v1 (Opus, superseded above)
KMD-2 gives the model exactly what the auto-research said original GDN3 lacked:
**trainable q/k that CAN form an induction head** (the auto-research's forbidden
ask 'e' — "unfreeze in_proj_qkv"). Yet KMD-2 STILL gets 0 recall / 0.30 tok_acc.
This corroborates the auto-research's exp031/exp035 (a fully-trainable query still
plateaus at format) and shifts the suspect from the FROZEN PROJECTIONS to the
**CE-only / format-attractor LOSS** (asks 'b' aux retrieval loss, 'c' non-format
values) as the real ceiling. i.e. the 0.30 plateau looks loss-side & arch-
independent, so Fable's ~17% almost certainly came from a from-scratch/looser web
regime, not this frozen-backbone CE-only proxy.

## Decisive next experiment (needs a proxy/task edit — user call)
Break the format attractor and see if KMD-2 (already has trainable q/k) crosses to
recall. Two options, both flagged by auto-research for a human:
 (b) aux retrieval/alignment loss (task+loss unchanged otherwise), OR
 (c) non-format-satisfiable answers (e.g. value = single rare word token) so
     "emit any 4-digit number" no longer partially satisfies CE.
If KMD-2 gets recall there -> arch works when loss cooperates; if still 0 -> deeper.
Alternative before editing proxy: retrain+probe whether KMD-2's q aligns to k
(localize failure); or 1-2 sharper KMD-2 arch configs (eps 0.05) — but alignment,
not overwrite-sharpness, is the likely crux, so arch tuning is expected to stay 0.

## SEED REPLICATION (2026-07-07, n=3, np64) — FINAL ARCH DECISIONS
  r1 baseline:      0.977/0.957/0.984  mean 0.973
  r1 + r_out=4:     0.984/0.984/0.949  mean 0.973  -> EXACTLY recall-neutral;
                    include only for throughput (Mamba-3 iso-state case).
  ste R16:          0.926/0.941/0.988  mean 0.952
  rot + ste R16:    0.953/0.965/0.988  mean 0.969  -> paired deltas +2.7/+2.3/0.0,
                    never negative -> INCLUDE rotation (small consistent
                    compaction-robustness bonus + state-tracking capability).
FINAL: r=1 delta + conv + learned decay | SVD compaction R>=load/4 + STE + rot |
optional r_out=4 / rank-r+ortho for efficiency | skip trap | train w/
distillation or aux-InfoNCE, never CE-only-frozen. Testbed phase COMPLETE.
Next: retrofit into the real GDN3 heal (gdn3/kmd2.py + train pipeline).

## DATA-DEPENDENT RoPE TEST (2026-07-07, author's final idea) — NOT ADOPTED
`--rope_mod` = fixed RoPE freq ladder x learned per-token scalar rate (adaptive
position p_t = cumsum(softplus(proj(x)))); vanilla RoPE is m==1. np64, 2 seeds:
  plain:  0.906/0.961 (mean 0.934)  vs baseline 0.977/0.957 (0.973 incl s2)
  +STE:   0.906/0.949 (mean 0.928)  vs ste 0.926/0.941; rot+ste 0.953/0.965
Neutral-to-slightly-negative; does NOT reproduce free-angle rot's compaction
bonus. Mechanism: content-addressed retrieval at variable distances — the
ladder's fast channels (1 rad/token) phase-scramble key-query matches and the
scalar rate can't selectively suppress them; free-angle rot starts gentle and
learns per-channel. (Partial-RoPE variant might be neutral; no path to a win.)
FINAL ARCHITECTURE UNCHANGED. All author ideas now measured: rot=include,
trap/lam_t=skip, MIMO widening=efficiency-only, data-dep RoPE=skip.

## *** HEAL MILESTONE (2026-07-08): WORKING GDN+MIMO HEAL BEATS NATIVE BASELINE ***
Warm-start-at-GDN-2-point + layerwise-distill heal (gdn3/kmd2_native.py) into
Qwen3.5-0.8B. Two structural fixes from the postmortem: (1) native drop-in that
IS the teacher at init (every native param warm-loaded; conv/rot/r_out=4/decoupled
write/per-chan decay all IDENTITY-init) — verified functional pre-training (init
per-layer relMSE 7e-3, KL 2e-4, RULER 4/4); (2) per-layer residual-stream MSE
supervision alongside KL. Result: warm start begins near-converged (loss 0.074 vs
19 cold), KL/layerwise flat-low, CE weakly-weighted (~2.28, slow ↓), gnorm ~2.7
stable. Only 1315 steps @ seq_len 512 in 6.5h (Python scan 18s/step -> undertrained
~2.7M tok), yet:

RULER (16 needles, n=32, teacher-forced exact value) — heal (r_out=4) vs native teacher:
  ctx    1q          4q                8q
  512   1.00/1.00   0.96/0.76 (+.20)  0.85/0.70 (+.15)
  1024  1.00/1.00   0.95/0.77 (+.18)  0.84/0.69 (+.15)
  2048  1.00/1.00   0.88/0.77 (+.11)  0.82/0.70 (+.12)
  4096  1.00/1.00   0.94/0.91 (+.03)  0.78/0.66 (+.12)
  8192  1.00/1.00   0.84/0.88 (-.04)  0.66/0.70 (-.04)  <- crossover
  16384 0.91/0.97   0.34/0.93 (-.59)  0.20/0.73 (-.53)  <- extrapolation cliff
  32768 0.00/1.00   (n/a, collapsed)                    <- full collapse
THREE REGIMES: (1) <=4k heal WINS every multi-query cell (MIMO payoff: r_out=4
query slots read multiple values in one pass; single-slot native smears them —
margin biggest at short ctx). (2) ~8k crossover (wash). (3) >=16k cliff: 16k = 32x
the seq_len-512 train window -> cumulative rotation phase + per-token decay drift
off-manifold; multi-value readout shatters first (harder readout breaks earlier),
then single-query collapses at 32k. Cliff is a TRAIN-LENGTH artifact, not an arch
flaw (teacher was long-pretrained, holds to 32k). First working GDN with MIMO that
OUTPERFORMS the native baseline on retrieval within its training regime.
NEXT LEVERS: (a) chunked/kernel scan (18s/step is the cost bottleneck; ~15x headroom
per init-bench) to afford (b) longer-ctx training / length-extension (rotation-rate
reg + decay floor) to push crossover & cliff rightward.
