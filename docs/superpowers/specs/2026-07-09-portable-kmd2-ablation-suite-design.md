# Portable KMD-2 Ablation Suite Design

**Date:** 2026-07-09

## Objective

Build a portable, reproducible ablation suite that can be uploaded to a faster
remote GPU server and can test proposed KMD-2 mechanisms in two complementary
settings:

1. a small, self-contained PyTorch backend for clean causal and mechanistic
   experiments; and
2. the current Qwen3.5-0.8B native warm-start KMD-2 backend for checkpoint
   reliance tests and short, controlled heal runs.

The suite must isolate one mechanism at a time, measure the ability that the
mechanism actually claims to improve, and demonstrate incremental value over
the complete current native implementation. A mechanism does not count as a
win merely because it replaces an existing feature that was disabled for the
experiment.

The deliverable is one command-line entry point backed by small focused
modules, configurations, tests, documentation, and verified upload bundles.

## Non-Goals

The initial suite will not:

- modify the production recurrence in `gdn3/kmd2_native.py`;
- reproduce HOLA as a separate non-KMD-2 model or claim a literal reproduction
  where the paper leaves implementation semantics unspecified;
- change or regenerate the surviving native-heal checkpoint;
- claim that a small synthetic result proves a language-model improvement;
- claim that a Qwen checkpoint intervention proves architectural causality;
- reproduce Mamba-3's 440M pretraining study;
- silently interpret the current shared-query `r_out=4` path as true rank-4
  MIMO;
- treat the user-proposed momentum equations as Nesterov without correcting
  their update and lookahead point;
- make the experimental recurrences compatible with the production fast scan
  before their reference-loop behavior earns promotion; or
- implement incremental decoding or claim bounded whole-model memory before the
  exact-cache mechanism passes its full-recomputation screen; or
- run every pairwise combination. Interaction tests are reserved for features
  that first pass their individual screen.

The exact-cache lane has one narrow production-path allowance:
`gdn3/kmd2_fast_scan.py` may add a separate score-returning entry point after
parity is proved. The current `scan()` signature, outputs, recurrence, and
`KMD2NativeAttn.forward` behavior remain unchanged.

## Current Native Baseline Contract

The canonical full-model control is `KMD2NativeAttn` selected by
`GDN3_KMD2_NATIVE=1`, with `GDN3_KMD2_ROUT=4` and the reference Python scan.
The fast scan is disabled for recurrence-changing experiments unless a variant
explicitly proves compatibility.

The suite must inventory the current implementation before creating jobs.

### Features already present

| Feature | Current implementation |
|---|---|
| Native Qwen warm load | q/k/v, convolution, gates, norm, and output path |
| Local mixing | Warm-loaded depthwise causal convolution plus SiLU |
| Rotation | Cumulative data-dependent paired q/k rotation |
| Output slots | `r_out=4` scaled copies of a shared query plus learned mixing |
| Decay | Native per-head decay plus learned per-key-channel offsets |
| Write control | Shared token logit plus a static per-head write offset; not independently token-controlled |
| Recurrent state | Dense `dk x dv` state, zeroed on every forward call |

### Features not currently present

| Feature | Required experimental interpretation |
|---|---|
| Trapezoidal state-input carry | Previous and current write factors blended inside the recurrence |
| B/C-style bias | New gated q/k channel biases after normalization |
| True MIMO | Independent rank-R write inputs and output queries sharing one state |
| Gated DeltaNet-2 gates | Independent token-conditioned key-channel erase and value-channel write projections |
| Momentum | A second full velocity state with a coherent lookahead update |
| Lookahead target | A causal, identity-gated value-space derivative correction |
| Native state-size knob | A changed native state shape; not warm-load compatible |
| Bounded exact cache | Per-head exact K/V retention selected from KMD-2 writes and read through a sharp cache-only path |

The cold `KMD2LinearAttn` and original `GDN3LinearAttn` paths are different
architectures. They are not valid substitutes for the native baseline.
`GDN3LinearAttn` does contain a circular exact `U,Vb` residual buffer, so the
inventory records that conceptual overlap. It is inactive when native KMD-2 is
selected, position/recency based, read linearly as part of state, and compacted
lossily; it is not the proposed top-surprise, sharply read cache.

### Gated DeltaNet-2 erase/write ablation

The native scalar-offset control remains unchanged. The tiny-only
`gdn2_decoupled.channelwise` arm implements the Gated DeltaNet-2 recurrence
with independent token projections:

```text
b_t = sigmoid(W_b x_t) in [0,1]^dk
w_t = sigmoid(W_w x_t) in [0,1]^dv
S_bar = D_t * S_prev
e_t = b_t * k_t
z_t = w_t * v_t
r_t = S_bar^T e_t
S_t = S_bar + k_t (z_t - r_t)^T
```

The left outer-product address remains `k_t`; only the erase/read direction is
gated as `b_t * k_t`. This is deliberately not implemented as two scalar
logits. Broadcasting scalar `beta_e` and `beta_w` across their respective
channels recovers the prior delta-rule update exactly. The initial arm is a
cold redesign at `mimo_rank=1`; exact-cache scoring and a fused scan are out of
scope until their gate-aware definitions and parity tests are added.

## Redundancy and No-Op Gates

Every experiment must pass the following gates before an expensive job is
launched.

### 1. Feature inventory gate

A versioned manifest records, for each feature:

- whether it is already present;
- its owning production file and parameter names;
- whether it affects projections, recurrence, readout, or dynamic state;
- its parameter and recurrent-state cost; and
- which backends and run modes support it.

Preflight checks the expected production attributes and a source hash. A stale
manifest fails loudly rather than running against a changed implementation.

### 2. Exact baseline gate

- The Qwen backend imports the production `KMD2NativeAttn`; it does not copy the
  production forward method into the suite.
- The tiny backend implements the same scalar gated-delta recurrence and is
  checked against the production `_scan` on deterministic synthetic tensors
  whenever the repository dependencies are available.
- Forward outputs, input gradients, and recurrence-parameter gradients are
  compared.
- The standalone tiny bundle records the production source hash used to
  certify its recurrence.

### 3. Identity gate

New warm-startable mechanisms are parameterized so their disabled or initial
state reproduces the complete current baseline. Before training, the suite
checks output and gradient parity at a declared tolerance.

State-size changes and true rank-R MIMO cannot pass a native warm-start identity
gate. They must be labelled cold/redesigned experiments instead of being
reported as native warm-start ablations.

### 4. Active-effect gate

The suite sets deterministic non-identity test parameters for each variant and
requires its outputs to differ from the baseline on a diagnostic input. A
variant that adds parameters but is disconnected, overwritten, or otherwise a
no-op is rejected.

The changed parameter names, trainable-parameter count, dynamic-state tensors,
and expected output difference are recorded in the run manifest.

### 5. Incremental-value gate

The primary comparison keeps all current native features enabled. A new feature
must improve over that complete baseline. If it helps only after an existing
feature is disabled, it is a replacement candidate, not an incremental win.

Promoted features receive a targeted interaction test with the closest current
or proposed mechanism:

| New feature | Interaction test |
|---|---|
| Trapezoidal carry | trapezoid x existing convolution |
| B/C-style bias | bias x trapezoid, then winning pair x convolution |
| Lookahead | lookahead x convolution; lookahead x trapezoid if both pass |
| Momentum | momentum x current decay/erase behavior |
| Rotation | rotation x pair-tied versus independent channel decay |
| State size / true MIMO | state size x SISO/true-MIMO; current `r_out=4` remains a separate control |
| Exact cache | cache x current rotation; cache x `r_out=1/4`; cache bytes x parameter-matched larger state in tiny backend |

New additions are classified as **incremental**, **replacement-only**,
**redundant**, **synergistic**, **harmful**, or **inconclusive** by the mutually
exclusive rules in "Metrics and Statistical Decisions." Existing rotation and
convolution are not additions; their on/off arms use the separate reliance
labels **relied-on**, **dispensable**, **harmful-current**, or
**inconclusive-reliance**.

## Architecture

The preferred layout is a portable suite directory with one CLI, not one large
monolithic script.

```

The implementation may consolidate very small modules, but it must preserve
the boundaries between configuration, task generation, model backends,
variants, execution, and result summarization.

## Command-Line Interface

The single entry point exposes four subcommands.

### `preflight`

Validates:

- Python and dependency availability;
- CUDA devices and requested dtypes;
- model, checkpoint, and dataset paths;
- current-feature inventory and source hashes;
- backend/variant/task compatibility;
- identity and active-effect gates;
- expanded job count and estimated state/parameter costs; and
- output-directory writability.

It supports `--dry-run` and produces a machine-readable preflight report.

### `run`

Required common arguments:

```text
--backend tiny|qwen
--config PATH
--out PATH
--job-index N
--num-jobs N
--resume
```

Qwen-only arguments include:

```text
--mode reliance|heal
--model PATH
--checkpoint PATH
--data PATH
--student-device cuda:N
--teacher-device cuda:N
```

The Qwen `reliance` mode does not require a teacher. The `heal` mode requires a
teacher unless a deliberately synthetic-only objective is selected.

### `summarize`

Aggregates completed run records, produces JSON and CSV summaries, computes
paired seed effects and confidence intervals, and applies the preregistered
classification rules.

### `bundle`

Creates one of two verified archives:

- a light tiny bundle containing the suite, configs, tests, requirements, and
  provenance manifest; or
- a Qwen bundle that additionally includes the required repository code but
  excludes model snapshots, datasets, and checkpoints by default.

The Qwen bundle manifest lists every external asset, expected path argument,
size, and optional checksum. The command reopens the completed archive and
verifies required entries, exclusions, and SHA-256 hashes.

## Configuration and Job Identity

Configuration uses JSON so it is available without optional parser packages.
The validated schema includes:

- schema and suite versions;
- backend and Qwen run mode;
- baseline name;
- mechanism and variant;
- task and task-specific parameters;
- seed list;
- training token/update budget;
- optimizer and schedule;
- model/state dimensions and finite `d_ff_match_min`/`d_ff_match_max` bounds;
- exact-cache width, processing-block size, admission score, read
  normalization/initialization, coordinate frame, fp32 compute dtype, explicit
  storage dtype, causality, tie policy, and cache-optimizer settings;
- exact-cache promotion thresholds for gate opening, persistent hit rate,
  conditional read accuracy, shuffled-cache dependence, and neighboring
  capacity stability;
- context-length curriculum and extrapolation lengths;
- primary metric, metric direction, `min_useful`, `harm_threshold`,
  `min_reliance`, and equivalence band;
- protected metrics with one `max_regression` value each;
- `min_synergy` for a declared four-cell interaction;
- device/dtype preferences; and
- required interaction or promotion stage.

All decision thresholds for one metric use that metric's normalized raw units.
Reliance configurations must satisfy
`min_reliance > equivalence >= 0` and `harm_threshold > equivalence`; preflight
rejects a configuration that could make reliance labels overlap.

A canonical serialization of semantic configuration fields produces the
experiment ID. Runtime-only fields such as output path and device number do not
change the ID. Resume skips only a run with a valid completed record matching
the same experiment ID and code provenance.

Job sharding is deterministic. `--job-index i --num-jobs n` selects a stable
subset, making the suite usable with Slurm arrays or several independent GPU
workers without a shared coordinator.

The shard assignment is language-independent:

```text
uint64_big_endian(sha256(job_id)[0:8]) mod num_jobs
```

`job_id` includes canonical semantic configuration, seed, and stage. Tests vary
JSON key order and `PYTHONHASHSEED` and require disjoint shards whose union is
the complete immutable job manifest.

## Backends

### Tiny backend

The tiny backend depends only on PyTorch and the standard library. It uses:

- a configurable token or continuous-input embedding;
- one or more residual blocks;
- the exact native scalar gated-delta state orientation and post-update read;
- optional current native convolution, rotation, shared-query output slots,
  per-channel decay, and write offset; and
- a task-appropriate classification, token, or regression head.

The default screening baseline includes the current native mechanisms. Each
experiment changes one declared factor. Learned absolute position embeddings
are prohibited in length-extrapolation tasks because they create an unrelated
extrapolation failure and can mask recurrent state tracking.

The tiny backend is the causal evidence backend. It answers whether a
mechanism can learn and extrapolate on its claimed behavior under controlled
capacity and data.

### Qwen backend

The Qwen backend imports the current upgrade manager and
`KMD2NativeAttn`. Experimental wrappers or subclasses live inside the suite;
the production forward method and recurrence are not copied. The exact-cache
subclass may override the scan call boundary to request update norms and add the
cache read. The only production-path extension is a separately named
`scan_with_update_norm()` helper in `gdn3/kmd2_fast_scan.py`; existing `scan()`
callers remain unchanged.

The suite owns installation; the production upgrade manager is not changed.
`install_exact_cache()` performs this ordered procedure:

1. load the base model and apply `GDN3UpgradeManager` in native mode;
2. when a native-heal checkpoint is declared, load it into those native layers
   first and require every supplied tensor name/shape to be consumed (missing
   non-checkpoint model keys are expected; unexpected checkpoint keys fail);
3. for each upgraded index, require an actual `KMD2NativeAttn`, construct
   `KMD2ExactCacheAttn.from_native(native_layer, cache_config)`, transfer every
   inherited parameter and buffer strictly by name/shape, and require the only
   newly initialized names to be the declared cache parameters;
4. preserve layer index, `r_out`, device, dtype, training state, and inherited
   `requires_grad` flags, verify inherited tensors are byte-equal before
   replacing `layer.linear_attn`; and
5. load a cache-enabled resume only after replacement, using a suite schema that
   requires all cache tensors and rejects missing or unexpected targeted-layer
   keys.

Paired native continuation uses the same pre-replacement checkpoint state. A
suite-owned `QwenExactCacheRunner` validates top-level call arguments before
every heal/evaluation forward; it rejects padding/packing, cache/decode state,
segment/reset metadata, and unsupported position semantics before the inherited
layer forward is entered. The initial path is supported only through this
runner, not as a general external model API.

Concretely, `attention_mask` is absent or all ones; `position_ids` is absent or
the monotonic `0..T-1` row for each example; `use_cache` is false; and
`cache_params`, `past_key_values`, `cache_position`, `cu_seqlens`,
`segment_ids`, and `reset_mask` are absent/empty. Any other value fails before
model execution.

It supports two evidence modes.

#### Reliance mode

Loads the existing native-heal checkpoint and performs deterministic
interventions without retraining. Initial interventions include:

- full learned rotation;
- rotation disabled;
- rotation bias only;
- token-shuffled rotation increments;
- cumulative phase reset at configured boundaries; and
- current convolution enabled or bypassed.

Reliance mode determines whether the checkpoint currently uses a feature. It
does not prove that the feature improved training.

Exact cache has no post-hoc reliance arm because it is absent from the current
checkpoint. Ungated cache probes are diagnostic only and cannot be reported as
checkpoint reliance or architectural gain.

#### Heal mode

Starts from native Qwen weights or the declared checkpoint, adds one
identity-gated compatible mechanism, and trains for a fixed paired budget using
the same examples, optimizer settings, and stopping rules as its baseline.

Trapezoid, B/C-style bias, lookahead, corrected momentum, and exact cache
require heal mode.
Recurrence-changing variants use the Python reference loop. The suite must not
fall back silently to the existing fast scan.

Exact cache does not change the recurrence and may use the score-returning fast
path only after output, score, selected-index, and gradient parity pass. The
**initial full-recomputation Qwen exact-cache mode** rejects incremental decode,
packed inputs, or cross-call state.

Native state-size changes and true MIMO are not valid warm-start heal arms.
They are tiny-backend experiments in the initial suite. A future Qwen cold or
adapter experiment requires a separate promotion design and must not be mixed
into native-heal summaries.

The Qwen backend is the transfer evidence backend. It answers whether a
mechanism remains useful in the hybrid language model without unacceptable
quality or efficiency regression.

## Experimental Mechanisms

### Current data-dependent rotation

The suite tests the existing production rotation; it does not add a second RoPE
implementation to Qwen.

Tiny controls:

- current cumulative data-dependent paired rotation;
- rotation disabled;
- learned constant-rate cumulative rotation;
- parameter-matched non-cumulative rotation;
- standard fixed-frequency RoPE; and
- explicit moving-frame state rotation oracle.

The exact complex-transition equivalence is tested separately under pair-tied
and independently learned channel decay. Success on a task must be described
as phase/state-tracking evidence unless the moving-frame equivalence conditions
also pass.

### Exponential-trapezoidal state-input carry

For one head, let `D_t` be the current per-key-channel decay and define:

```text
S_bar = D_t * S_prev
m_t = k_t^T S_bar
E_t = k_t (beta_e,t * m_t)^T
u_t = beta_w,t * v_t
U_t = k_t u_t^T
U_prev = k_prev u_prev^T
r_t = rho_head * sigmoid(rho_proj(x_t))
S_t = S_bar - E_t + (1 - r_t) U_t + r_t (D_t * U_prev)
```

`rho_head` is a projected per-head parameter constrained to `[0, 1]`, initialized
at exactly zero, and projected back into the interval after each optimizer
step. This gives it a usable boundary gradient while preserving an exact native
identity. The token-dependent projection may begin learning once `rho_head`
moves away from zero.

The carry stores differentiable factors `k_prev` and
`u_prev = beta_w,prev * v_prev`, not a full `dk x dv` matrix. At the first valid
token and every explicit sequence/packed-segment boundary, the carry is cleared
and `r_t` is forced to zero. The previous write is transported by the current
decay `D_t`; the current erase remains based on `beta_e,t` and the decayed
pre-update state. Carry tensors are not detached during training.

Identity proof: with `rho_head=0`, `r_t=0` and the equation reduces to
`S_t = S_bar - E_t + U_t`, exactly the current native update. A classical
equal-endpoint mixture is not native-warm compatible and is not used for the
Qwen heal arm.

This is an adaptation of trapezoidal state-input mixing to a delta-style
associative memory, not a claim of a formally derived second-order KMD-2
integrator. KMD-2 has no exposed continuous-time `Delta_t`, so the suite does
not attach an unsupported second-order accuracy claim to this recurrence.

### B/C-style q/k bias

Adds separate learned head/channel q and k biases after normalization. Qwen
uses an identity gate initialized to zero so the warm start is preserved.

```text
q_biased = q_normalized + a_q,head * b_q,head
k_biased = k_normalized + a_k,head * b_k,head
```

The per-head amplitudes `a_q` and `a_k` are initialized at exactly zero; bias
vectors may be initialized independently because their contribution is then
exactly zero. The active-effect gate sets nonzero amplitudes and bias vectors.
The tiny affine-regression control replaces the additive vectors with an
equal-parameter diagonal rescaling, which cannot supply a constant coordinate.

Bias is screened alone first. It is combined with trapezoidal carry only after
one of the individual arms passes, because their reported language-model role
may overlap with the existing convolution.

### Existing convolution ablation

The suite toggles the current native convolution. It never stacks a duplicate
short convolution.

The primary incremental baseline keeps convolution enabled. Convolution-off
runs answer whether another feature can replace it and are labelled
replacement tests.

### KMD-2 bounded exact cache

This lane adapts the bounded exact-memory idea in
[HOLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02303) to the actual native KMD-2 update. It
is a separate read-side/dynamic-memory addition, not another recurrence and not
a standalone reproduction of the paper.

The paper does not fully specify its gate activation, null-sink equation,
per-head versus shared selection, hard-top-k gradient semantics, tie breaking,
or exact block merge/read order. The definitions below are therefore the
normative KMD-2 adaptation and are reported as such rather than attributed to
the paper.

For one head, native KMD-2 computes:

```text
S_bar = D_t * S_prev
m_t = k_t^T S_bar
u_t = beta_w,t * v_t - beta_e,t * m_t
S_t = S_bar + k_t u_t^T
score_exact,t = ||k_t||_2 * ||u_t||_2 = ||k_t u_t^T||_F
```

The exact score is the magnitude of the rank-one change actually committed by
KMD-2, excluding the separate decay of old state. Production normalization uses
an epsilon floor, so a zero or sub-epsilon projected key is not unit norm; the
`||k_t||_2` factor is required rather than assumed away. For ordinary nonzero
unit keys and the native warm start `beta_w=beta_e=beta`, the score reduces to
the paper-style `beta * ||v_t - m_t||`. After the write gate decouples, the
paper-style expression and actual KMD-2 update magnitude are distinct arms.

#### Cache contents and causal selection

The default cache is independent for every batch item and head. It stores:

- the actual rotated, epsilon-normalized key used by the recurrence;
- the corresponding raw post-convolution/SiLU value `v_t`, never `u_t`;
- the detached fp32 admission score;
- the absolute position; and
- validity.

The persistent capacity is `w` entries per head. For a processing block, the
visible set at token `t` is the persistent top-`w` from completed blocks, the
inclusive causal current-block prefix `j <= t`, and one null sink. At block end,
the next persistent set is selected from the old persistent set plus all valid
tokens in the completed block. The total order is score descending and absolute
position descending, so newer tokens deterministically win exact score ties.
Selection is non-differentiable: scores and indices are detached, while gathered
K/V tensors retain their ordinary within-forward gradient paths.

Score computation and the cache read use fp32. Storage has a separate explicit
`cache_storage_dtype`: tiny/oracle runs default to fp32 and the primary Qwen arm
uses bf16. Admission casts the actual rotated `k` and raw `v` to storage dtype;
read casts them back to fp32 before RMSNorm, logits, and value accumulation. The
cast remains differentiable during full recomputation. Here "exact K/V" means
an uncompressed token-level association at the declared storage dtype, not a
bitwise fp32 copy. Reference and fast implementations compare after the same
storage round-trip; an fp32-storage diagnostic reports quantization sensitivity
but is not substituted silently for the configured Qwen arm.

The processing-block size `C_cache` is independent of both persistent width
`w` and the numerical fast-scan chunk. `w=0` is allowed only for the declared
current-block-only control; a top-surprise experiment requires `w >= 1`, at
least two processing blocks, and enough candidates to cause eviction.

#### Sharp cache-only read

The cache uses the query represented by the existing shared-query output mixer:

```text
q_eff = sum_r out_mix_r * q_slot_r
q_tilde = gamma_q * q_eff / sqrt(mean(q_eff^2) + eps_cache)
k_tilde_j = gamma_k * k_j / sqrt(mean(k_j^2) + eps_cache)
logit_j = q_tilde^T k_tilde_j / sqrt(dk)
logit_sink = sink_logit_head
a = softmax([logit_valid, logit_sink])
y_cache = sum_j a_j * v_j              # sink value is exactly zero
y = y_state + lambda_head * y_cache
```

The Q/K RMSNorm scale vectors are cache-only and shared across heads within a
layer; they never alter the recurrence factors. `gamma_q` and `gamma_k`
initialize to ones, `eps_cache` defaults to the model RMS epsilon (or `1e-6`
when unavailable), and every per-head sink logit initializes to zero. The sink
logit and cache amplitude are per head. `lambda_head` is directly trainable,
constrained to `[0,1]`, and initialized at exactly zero. This preserves the
checkpoint output while giving the amplitude a usable first-step gradient;
the optimizer projects it back into `[0,1]` after every step;
the norm and sink parameters may begin receiving gradients after the amplitude
opens. The cache sum is applied before the existing gated RMSNorm and output
projection. Cache amplitude, RMSNorm scales, and sink logits use a dedicated
AdamW group with declared `lr_cache`, the same betas/epsilon/schedule as the
memory group, and zero weight decay. The amplitude is projected after each
optimizer step; an out-of-range resumed amplitude is rejected, not silently
projected. All cache parameters and optimizer state are serialized in the suite
resume format.

Rotated recurrence-space K/V is the primary arm. A pre-rotation cache coordinate
is a promoted diagnostic only, because it requires a broader experimental
forward adapter and changes the positional information available to retrieval.
`r_out=4` still creates one cache entry per token/head. Per-slot cache reads are
an interaction experiment, not the default and not true MIMO.

#### Admission and read controls

All admission arms use identical capacity, block geometry, read, gate, training
budget, and examples:

- exact KMD-2 committed update `||k|| ||beta_w v - beta_e m||`;
- coupled-paper port `||k|| beta_w ||v - m||`;
- residual only `||k|| ||v - m||`;
- write-value only `||k|| beta_w ||v||`;
- recency/FIFO;
- seeded reservoir/random; and
- a future-query oracle used only as a diagnostic ceiling.

The unit-L2 read uses `q_hat^T k_hat / sqrt(dk)`. Its fixed-temperature control
uses `sqrt(dk) * q_hat^T k_hat`, equivalent to temperature `dk` under the same
division and matching the ideal `gamma=1` RMSNorm scale. The learned arm uses
the explicit cache-only RMSNorm above. All share the zero sink initialization.
Cache-off and current-block-only controls separate persistent exact memory from
local exact attention.

#### Fast-scan instrumentation

The chunk scan already solves for the per-token `u_t` vectors as `U`. A separate
`scan_with_update_norm()` entry point may return
`(y, ||k||_2 * ||U||_2)` without changing
the existing `scan()` API; the returned fp32 norms are detached before policy
selection. The experimental subclass overrides only the scan
call boundary and reuses the production forward projections, rotation, norm,
and output path. Reference full recomputation remains authoritative until the
fast path matches state output, scores, selected indices, cache read, and
gradients. Float64 oracle tests use `atol=1e-10, rtol=1e-8`; fp32 reference
tests use `atol=1e-6, rtol=1e-5`; CUDA fast-path gates retain the current
`<2e-3` forward relMSE and `<1e-2` gradient relMSE limits. Score/index parity
uses both well-separated scores and constructed exact ties. The initial
full-recomputation Qwen exact-cache mode does not accept or return streaming
state.

### Corrected momentum

The suite does not implement the originally proposed
`W_t = decay(W_{t-1}) + V_t + gamma V_t`, which double-counts the velocity and
does not evaluate a Nesterov lookahead.

For state `S` and velocity `M`, the coherent experimental form is:

```text
S_bar = decay(S_prev)
M_bar = decay(M_prev)
S_look = S_bar + gamma * M_bar
error = beta_w * v - beta_e * (k^T S_look)
G = k error^T
M = gamma * M_bar + G
S = S_bar + M
```

At `gamma=0`, this recovers the current delta update. Momentum doubles the
large dynamic recurrent state and is reported as such. It is reference-loop
only until it demonstrates enough value to justify a new scan derivation.

### Lookahead value target

Uses a causal value-space finite difference rather than calling a projection
of raw hidden-state differences an exact derivative:

```text
v_target = v_t + rho_t * P(v_t - v_prev)
```

`rho` is identity-gated at zero. The mechanism stores previous value factors
and leaves the base scan interface unchanged. It is described as causal
extrapolation, not an implicit solve.

### State-size and true-MIMO sweep

The tiny backend runs two distinct sweeps. The **state-size sweep** fixes
`d_model`, layer count, head count, and MIMO rank at `R=1`, then varies declared
`(dk, dv)` pairs; recurrent capacity is reported as `heads * dk * dv` elements.
The **MIMO-rank sweep** fixes `d_model`, layers, heads, `dk`, `dv`, and therefore
the recurrent-state size, then varies `R`. A declared factorial may vary both,
but it remains labelled as a factorial rather than either one-dimensional
sweep.

Each sweep has a raw fixed-FFN comparison, which keeps the feed-forward hidden
dimension fixed and reports the resulting parameter-count change, and a
separate parameter-matched comparison defined below.

For each head, true MIMO uses row-normalized independent keys
`K_t [R, dk]`, independent queries `Q_t [R, dk]`, one base value and output-gate
projection `v_t, z_t [dv]`, per-slot erase/write gates `beta_e [R]` and
`beta_w [R]`, and one shared state `S [dk, dv]`. Following Mamba-3 Appendix C,
the base value and gate are expanded with learned data-independent channelwise
rank scalings `M_V, M_Z [R, dv]`, and the gated rank outputs are contracted by
`M_O [R, dv]`. This is the Mamba-3 lightweight parameterization adapted to
KMD-2's gated-delta update rather than a claim that the two recurrences are
identical. All slots update simultaneously:

```text
S_bar = D_t * S_prev
K_e = diag(sqrt(beta_e / R)) K_t
S_erase = S_bar - K_e^T (K_e S_bar)
V_t = v_t[None, :] * M_V
S_t = S_erase + K_t^T diag(beta_w) V_t
Y_t = Q_t S_t
Z_t = z_t[None, :] * M_Z
Y'_t = Y_t * silu(Z_t)
y_t = sum_r M_O[r, :] * Y'_t[r, :]
```

The erase is the order-invariant average
`sum_r (beta_e,r / R) k_r (k_r^T S_bar)`. Tests require forward and gradient
invariance under a common slot permutation. As in the released Mamba-3
implementation, `M_V` and `M_O` initialize to `1/R` and `M_Z` initializes to
one. Unlike the old unit-L2 scalar output mixer, the channelwise contraction
occurs after the rank-specific nonlinear gate and therefore cannot generally
collapse to one effective query. At `R=1`, the state update still reduces
exactly to the declared native SISO recurrence; the Tiny projected path also
uses the same base output gate in both its SISO and MIMO models.

The current `r_out=4` shared-query slots are another separate control and are
never relabelled as true MIMO.

Parameter matching uses exact instantiated trainable-parameter counts, not a
projection-only estimate:

- **State-size matching:** the target is the configured canonical `R=1` model
  at `(dk_ref, dv_ref)`. Each alternate `(dk, dv)` arm keeps `d_model`, layers,
  heads, and `R=1` fixed and adjusts only the shared per-layer feed-forward
  hidden dimension, upward or downward, to compensate for changed q/k/v,
  gate, rotation, normalization, and output-projection parameters.
- **MIMO-rank matching:** the target is the `R=1` model at the same `(dk, dv)`.
  Each `R>1` arm keeps recurrent state and all other dimensions fixed and
  adjusts only that feed-forward hidden dimension to compensate for the added
  independent slot projections and gates.
- **Declared factorial matching:** the target is the canonical
  `(dk_ref, dv_ref, R=1)` model, and the same feed-forward-only adjustment
  compensates for both changes together.

For every matched arm, preflight instantiates each feed-forward candidate in the
configured finite interval `[d_ff_match_min, d_ff_match_max]` (`d_ff >= 8`, both
bounds and candidates divisible by 8), chooses the one minimizing absolute
count difference, and requires the resulting total trainable-parameter count
to be within the larger of 0.5% of the target or 1,024 parameters. It rejects
the arm when no legal candidate satisfies the tolerance. The bounds, target
count, selected `d_ff`, exact arm count, and residual mismatch are reported.
Thus state-size matching may increase FFN capacity while MIMO matching will
usually reduce it; neither silently changes recurrent-state bytes.

Primary reporting includes quality, state bytes, parameter count, training
throughput, and single-step/reference-loop latency. No automatic 2x efficiency
claim is permitted.

## Task Matrix

Each mechanism has one primary task family chosen for discriminative power.
Shared language-model and retrieval tasks are secondary transfer measures.

| Mechanism | Primary ability | Primary task | Key failure measure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rotation | cyclic state tracking | parity, modular counter, toggle FSM | OOD length collapse; angle intervention sensitivity |
| Trapezoid | variable-step temporal integration | irregular-time driven decay/integration | error versus time gap and forcing curvature |
| Convolution | local order and binding | adjacent key/value, short motif, delayed copy | accuracy versus local separation |
| Momentum | inertia in a persistent mapping | gradual drift followed by abrupt reversal | adaptation lag and reversal overshoot |
| Lookahead | causal trajectory extrapolation | linear/sinusoidal motion plus change points | smooth-segment gain versus change-point harm |
| State size / MIMO | capacity per state byte | MQAR load and length sweep | quality-state-latency Pareto frontier |
| B/C bias | affine constant-basis memory | symmetric affine associative regression | intercept error; zero-intercept negative control |
| Exact cache | episodic exceptions beside compressive state | structured-plus-exceptions, far retention, and overwrite freshness | cache miss, wrong read, or stale retrieval |

### State-tracking tasks

Parity and modular counting include `HOLD` and explicit `QUERY` operations.
Toggle FSM adds `SET0`, `SET1`, `TOGGLE`, `NOOP`, and `QUERY`. These resets and
overwrites distinguish an updateable state from a model that only accumulates
phase to the final token.

Training uses a length curriculum and evaluates held-out 2x and 4x operation
counts. Both raw accuracy and chance-adjusted accuracy are reported.

### Irregular-time integration

Samples the stable scalar/vector system `dh/dt = -a h + u(t)` with `a > 0`,
piecewise-linear forcing between observed endpoint values, and irregular time
gaps `Delta`. Inputs contain the forcing endpoint and elapsed delta. For one
component, with `e = exp(-a Delta)` and
`m = (u_t - u_prev) / Delta`, the exact target is:

```text
h_t = e h_prev
    + u_prev (1 - e) / a
    + m [Delta / a - (1 - e) / a^2]
```

The generator evaluates this in float64 with `expm1`-stable branches for small
`a Delta` and verifies samples against a fixed high-resolution RK4 oracle. The
oracle is validation-only and is shared by every model variant.

Evaluation stratifies error by delta, sequence length, and forcing curvature.
This directly tests temporal integration instead of using general perplexity as
a proxy.

### Drift and reversal

Generates key/value mappings that drift smoothly for a declared interval and
then change abruptly. Queries occur before the next observation so the model
cannot copy the target token.

Metrics include steady-state error, adaptation lag, peak overshoot, recovery
time, and the smooth-drift/reversal tradeoff. Momentum is useful only if its
smooth-regime gain is not purchased with excessive reversal failure.

### Trajectory extrapolation

Generates piecewise linear and sinusoidal value trajectories with withheld
next-step targets. Change-point cases are balanced with smooth cases.

Metrics separately report smooth forecast error, phase lag, change-point
overshoot, and recovery time. This prevents a lookahead mechanism from being
declared a temporal win based only on easy smooth segments.

### Local binding and MQAR

Local binding controls convolution with adjacent and separated key/value
tokens. MQAR varies number of bindings, queries, overwrite frequency, and
distance. Results include token accuracy, episode exact match, and distance/load
bins.

### Structured-plus-exceptions memory

This is the primary mechanistic task for exact cache. Each episode defines a
compressible mapping that the dense recurrent state can represent, then adds a
small set of one-shot arbitrary exceptions. Queries are stratified into normal
rule items and episodic exceptions. OOD evaluation varies unseen keys/values,
rule family, exception fraction, distance, and 2x/4x load.

Interventions report full model, state-only, cache-only, shuffled-cache,
wrong-value-cache, and oracle-cache results. A valid semiparametric result must
improve exception retrieval over state-only, retain the state advantage on
compressible items over cache-only, and lose its exception gain when cache
entries are shuffled. Overall accuracy without these strata is insufficient.

### Selector replay and far-surprise retention

Before training cache reads, deterministic native traces are replayed through
each admission policy. Tasks include MQAR, an early queried fact followed by
recent distractors, deliberately high-residual but unqueried distractors, and
loads above cache capacity. Metrics include query-relevant coverage at `w`,
selector precision/AUPRC, survival by age, cache hit rate, and an oracle-policy
ceiling. This separates admission quality from q/k alignment and read quality.

### Temporal freshness

Freshness episodes rebind the same key from `v_0` through later values, then
query the latest value. They vary update count, update gap, query lag, cache
saturation, and adversarial cases where an old entry has the larger immutable
score. Explicit requests for historical values form a separate split and are
never mixed into the latest-value metric.

Reported metrics are latest-value accuracy, stale-old-value prediction rate,
duplicate-key occupancy, update latency, and attention mass on old versus new
entries. This discrete versioning test is distinct from the smooth drift task:
an exact cache is not a temporal improvement if it preserves old facts at the
cost of current truth.

### Cache read and capacity diagnostics

When the queried item is cached, the suite reports top-1 key accuracy, gold
attention mass, entropy/effective support, wrong-key rate, and cache-only value
exact match. Every generated fact carries an exact source-position annotation;
for a multi-token Qwen needle, a persistent hit means at least one valid cache
position lies in the gold needle span, and top-1 is correct only when its
position lies in that span. Atomic/direct-factor tasks use their single declared
write position. Capacity sweeps use `w={0,8,16,32,64,128}` with fixed block size;
only the winning policy/read subsequently sweeps
`C_cache={64,128,256}`. MQAR loads and query counts cross below, near, and above
`w`. Quality is reported against persistent/working bytes, latency, and VRAM,
including a tiny-backend comparison with an equally sized recurrent-state
increase and an unbounded exact-memory oracle.

### Affine associative regression

This direct-factor tiny task isolates the constant basis supplied by q/k
biases. Each episode samples a linear map `A` and intercept `b`, observes
write pairs `y_i = A x_i + b`, and predicts a held-out query target. Write keys
are generated in exact `x, -x` pairs so their episode mean is zero and the
intercept cannot be inferred from a spurious key mean.

The task feeds q/k/v factors directly to the memory-cell harness. q/k
projections, readout, and all competing paths are bias-free; there is no MLP,
learned position embedding, constant input coordinate, or token-type feature in
the q/k path. The query/write role is supplied as an external mask rather than
an embedded marker. A parameter-matched diagonal-rescaling control has the same
number of trainable scalars but cannot add a constant basis. An oracle arm
explicitly appends a constant coordinate.

The primary metric is held-out query MSE, with intercept error and slope error
reported separately. Evaluation includes more writes and a wider query range
than training. A balanced `b=0` negative-control split must show no material
bias advantage; nonzero intercepts are sampled symmetrically and independently
of `A`, writes, and queries. Generator tests verify symmetry, independence,
absence of constant q/k inputs, and withheld-query targets.

## Screening and Promotion

### Stage 0: local correctness

- configuration and inventory validation;
- deterministic task tests and answer-leak checks;
- recurrence forward/backward parity;
- exact-cache update-score, selection, causality, and zero-gate parity;
- identity and active-effect gates;
- CPU tiny smoke run; and
- optional CUDA smoke run.

### Stage 1: tiny screening

- three paired seeds;
- fixed short update/token budget;
- current complete baseline versus one mechanism;
- in-distribution plus 2x/4x extrapolation; and
- primary task and efficiency metrics.

### Stage 2: tiny promotion and redundancy

Only arms exceeding the preregistered useful threshold advance to:

- five paired seeds;
- larger contexts and task loads;
- closest-mechanism interaction tests; and
- secondary retrieval or small-LM transfer tests.

### Stage 3: Qwen reliance

Runs deterministic interventions on the same evaluation examples. Rotation is
evaluated at 512, 2K, 4K, 8K, and 16K where feasible. Results use paired
episode-level intervals.

Teacher-forced evaluation is labelled as such. A material result is confirmed
on a smaller free-generation set before being described as a generation gain.

### Stage 4: Qwen heal

Only compatible tiny winners receive paired baseline/variant heal runs. Runs
use identical data order, update/token budget, learning-rate groups, and
evaluation examples. Full current native features remain enabled unless the
declared experiment is a replacement interaction.

Exact-cache Qwen promotion uses three paired heal seeds and at least 64 matched
RULER episodes per cell. A one-seed or 512-token-only run is a feasibility
result, not evidence of long-context transfer. Training context or curriculum
is declared in configuration and identical across baseline, recency, and
surprise-policy arms.

### Exact-cache staged screen

Exact cache uses the following serial gates rather than a full Cartesian sweep:

1. **selector replay:** compare exact KMD-2 score, coupled-paper port,
   residual-only, write-value-only, recency, reservoir, and oracle policies on
   the same native traces without a learned read;
2. **read screen:** fix the strongest non-oracle policy and compare unit-L2,
   matched fixed-temperature, and cache-only RMSNorm reads;
3. **capacity screen:** sweep `w={0,8,16,32,64,128}` with fixed `C_cache`, then
   sweep `C_cache={64,128,256}` only for the winning policy/read;
4. **tiny promotion:** run five paired seeds on structured-plus-exceptions,
   MQAR, far-surprise distractors, and temporal freshness;
5. **native interactions:** run separate four-cell cache x rotation and cache x
   `r_out={1,4}` factorials only after cache passes alone; and
6. **Qwen heal:** compare paired native continuation, capacity/read-matched
   recency cache, and the winning surprise cache.

For cache interactions with an existing feature, let `A` be cache off/on and
`B` be the existing feature off/on (`B=1` is the complete-current setting:
learned rotation or `r_out=4`). The four cells are `M00`, `M10`, `M01`, and
`M11`. Cache's incremental effect against the complete current implementation
is `direction*(M11-M01)`; its feature-off replacement contrast is
`direction*(M10-M00)`. Neither is replaced by the interaction statistic.

Tiny selector/read promotion uses an absolute five-point lower-confidence-bound
gain on the declared primary accuracy metric. Short-context accuracy must have
`L >= -0.02` versus native. Latest-value accuracy and direction-normalized
stale-error effect must each have `L >= -0.02` versus both matched native and
matched recency controls; passing only the weaker control is insufficient.

### Promotion from full recomputation to Option 3 streaming

Option 3 has two independently evaluated preregistered branches:

- **surprise branch:** `variant` is the winning preregistered surprise policy;
  it must pass gates 1-8, including the direct surprise-versus-recency gate 3;
- **recency branch:** `variant` is the matched recency cache; it must pass gates
  1, 2, and 4-8; gate 3 is not applicable and the result receives no
  surprise-selection label.

Unless a rule explicitly says deterministic, each gate applies to a paired 95%
bootstrap interval over matched seeds/examples. Items 1, 2, and 4 use
`variant - matched native continuation`; gate 3 uses
`surprise - matched recency`; gate 5 must pass separately against both controls.

1. macro per-answer recall over `{16K,32K} x {4q,8q}` has paired 95% interval
   lower bound at least `+0.10` versus native continuation;
2. at least two individual long-context cells also have lower bound at least
   `+0.10`, so the claim cannot rely only on a collapsed 32K baseline;
3. for the surprise branch only, the surprise policy has long-context lower
   bound at least `+0.05` versus a capacity/read/gate/budget-matched recency
   cache;
4. 512-4K macro recall lower bound is at least `-0.02`, no individual short
   cell is below `-0.03`, 8K is no worse than `-0.03`, and episode exact-match
   macro is no worse than `-0.05`;
5. latest-value accuracy and direction-normalized stale-error effect each have
   lower bound at least `-0.02` versus both native and recency;
6. the upper bound of `CE_variant-CE_native` is at most `0.02`; the upper bound
   of `KL_variant-KL_native` is at most
   `max(0.005, 0.05 * mean(KL_native))`, where the mean is from the matched
   native-continuation examples; non-finite values or skipped steps fail
   deterministically;
7. `w=64` passes the primary `+0.10` gate and at least one adjacent capacity
   (`w=32` or `w=128`) has primary lower bound at least `+0.05`; no result that
   requires `w>128` can promote; and
8. the mean final cache amplitude across installed heads/layers is at least the
   configured `min_gate_mean` (default `0.005`) and the maximum is at least
   `min_gate_max` (default `0.02`); on the primary long cells, persistent queried
   item hit-rate lower bound is at least `min_persistent_hit` (default `0.25`),
   conditional-on-hit cache top-1 key accuracy lower bound is at least
   `min_conditional_read` (default `0.50`), and shuffling cache values causes a
   recall-drop lower bound of at least `min_shuffle_drop` (default `0.05`).

Those defaults are part of the committed promotion configuration and may be
changed only before jobs are expanded. They are never inferred from observed
results.

If the surprise branch passes, Option 3 integrates surprise selection. Otherwise
it may integrate recency only if the recency branch passes. If neither branch
passes, Option 3 does not begin. A result that needs changed decay, recurrence,
rotation resets, or another simultaneous mechanism fails both branches.

#### Option 3 state and execution contract

Per KMD-2 layer, streaming must carry:

```text
S                  fp32 [B,H,dk,dv]
conv_tail           model_dtype [B,conv_dim,conv_k-1]
phase               fp32 [B,H,dk/2]
next_position       int64 [B]
persistent.{k,v}    cache_storage_dtype [B,H,w,dk or dv]
persistent.score    fp32 [B,H,w]
persistent.position int64 [B,H,w]
persistent.valid    bool [B,H,w]
block.{k,v}          cache_storage_dtype bounded current-block prefix
block.{score,position,valid}     fp32/int64/bool metadata
block_length        int64 [B]
```

For each accepted token, convolution history is applied first, phase is
advanced and q/k rotated, the unchanged decay/erase/write update and score are
computed, the current K/V is appended to the current-block buffer, and the
inclusive persistent-plus-block cache is read before the output is committed.
When `C_cache` entries complete a block, persistent top-`w` is selected with
score-descending/position-descending order and the block buffer is cleared.

`state=None` or an explicit reset mask clears every field before processing.
Padding rows are complete state no-ops. EOS does not implicitly reset. Beam
reordering covers every field without aliasing duplicated beams, and rejected
speculative tokens never commit their transactional state.

For one stored entry, logical bytes are
`(dk+dv)*bytes(cache_storage_dtype) + 4(score) + 8(position) + 1(valid)`;
reports include both this tensor-byte formula and measured allocator usage. At
`w=64`, bf16 persistent K/V plus metadata for all 18 native layers is about
9.23 MiB per beam. The bounded bf16 current-block K/V plus metadata is about
36.91 MiB at `C_cache=256`. fp32 storage approximately doubles only the K/V
portion (about 18.23 and 72.91 MiB respectively). Logit/softmax working
allocations are measured separately and may not be hidden from peak-memory
figures.

The Option 3 persistent-cache acceptance limit is 10 MiB/beam only for the
declared bf16 `w=64` arm; other dtypes use the formula-derived limit recorded in
configuration. Option 3 also requires decode throughput at least `0.80x`,
prefill at least `0.75x`, and KMD-2 dynamic memory flat with context. The six
preserved full-attention layers still have growing KV caches, so no whole-model
O(1) memory claim is permitted.

## Metrics and Statistical Decisions

Every run records:

- task primary and secondary metrics;
- loss curves and non-finite/skip counts;
- trainable and total parameter counts;
- recurrent-state elements and bytes per layer/sample;
- wall time, examples/tokens per second, and peak allocated VRAM;
- checkpoint and data identity;
- exact command, canonical configuration, seed, and experiment ID;
- Git revision and relevant source hashes; and
- Python, PyTorch, CUDA, GPU, and dependency versions.

Exact-cache runs additionally record cache width/block size, score definition,
fp32 compute dtype, storage dtype, coordinate frame, inclusive-causal and tie policies, amplitude
initial/final values, selected-index digest, selection-score statistics,
retention/eviction counts, queried-item hit rate, recall conditional on a hit,
sink mass, attention entropy/top-1 mass, stale-key occupancy/error, cache/state
output norms, persistent and block-workspace bytes, and the reference/fast
implementation paths. Smoke/parity records retain full scores and indices;
large runs retain canonical digests plus bounded deterministic samples.

Screening configurations preregister:

- a primary metric;
- minimum useful effect;
- maximum acceptable regression on protected metrics;
- seed count;
- training budget;
- promotion rule; and
- interaction test if promoted.

Summaries show each seed, mean/median, paired deltas, and a paired bootstrap
confidence interval. A best seed is never reported as the aggregate result.

### Normalized effect convention

Every metric declares `direction` as `+1` when larger is better or `-1` when
smaller is better. For a variant `V` and its paired baseline `B`, the effect in
the metric's configured raw units is:

```text
d = direction * (metric(V) - metric(B))
```

The suite computes a paired 95% bootstrap interval `[L, U]` using matched seeds
and matched evaluation examples within each seed. Configurations define
`min_useful > 0`, `harm_threshold > 0`, and, for every protected metric,
`max_regression >= 0`. A protected metric is certified safe only when its lower
interval bound is at least `-max_regression`.

### Promotion rule for new additions

A new addition advances from screening only when:

1. the primary effect has `L >= min_useful`; and
2. every protected metric is certified safe.

Point estimates alone never promote an arm. A replacement-only result does not
enter a native additive heal unless a separate deployment objective explicitly
values removal of the replaced feature.

### Mutually exclusive classification for new additions

Rules are evaluated in this order:

1. **failed/invalid:** the run or a required validity gate failed;
2. **harmful:** `U <= -harm_threshold`, or a protected metric has
   `U < -max_regression` (confident unacceptable regression);
3. **synergistic:** interaction arm only; it is protected-safe and the lower
   interval bound for
   `I = direction * (M11 - M10 - M01 + M00)` is at least the configured
   `min_synergy`;
4. **incremental:** `L >= min_useful` against the complete current baseline and
   all protected metrics are safe;
5. **replacement-only:** not incremental, but `L >= min_useful` in the declared
   existing-feature-off contrast and protected metrics are safe;
6. **redundant:** `U < min_useful`, `L > -harm_threshold`, and no replacement or
   synergy rule applies; or
7. **inconclusive:** every remaining valid result, including an interval that
   still contains both a useful gain and meaningful harm.

Every four-cell contrast uses matched examples, seed set, metric direction, and
budget. For two absent additions, `M00` is the complete current baseline. For an
addition crossed with an existing feature, `M01` is the complete current
baseline and the incremental addition contrast is `M11-M01` as defined above.
Interactions that do not have all four factorial cells are invalid rather than
approximated.

### Reliance semantics for existing features

Rotation and convolution on/off tests measure the effect
`d_reliance = direction * (full_current - ablated)`. They do not use the new
addition labels. Preflight enforces
`min_reliance > equivalence >= 0` and `harm_threshold > equivalence`. The
following ordered rules are therefore mutually exclusive:

1. **failed/invalid:** the run or a required validity gate failed;
2. **harmful-current:** `U <= -harm_threshold`;
3. **relied-on:** `L >= min_reliance`;
4. **dispensable:** the entire interval lies inside the preregistered
   equivalence band `[-equivalence, +equivalence]`; or
5. **inconclusive-reliance:** every remaining valid reliance result.

Reliance results can motivate a later removal design, but cannot be reported as
evidence that an absent feature is incremental.

## Result Storage and Resume

Each job writes to a temporary file and atomically renames it only after a
complete record is serialized. The output tree contains:

```text
results/
|-- manifest.json
|-- jobs.json
|-- runs/<experiment-id>/<seed>.json
|-- checkpoints/<experiment-id>/<seed>/
|-- events/worker-<job-index>-of-<num-jobs>.jsonl
`-- summary/
    |-- ledger.jsonl
    |-- results.json
    `-- results.csv
```

`jobs.json` is an immutable canonical job manifest written once by preflight
before workers start. Workers never append to a shared file. The authoritative
result is the atomic per-run JSON record: a worker writes a uniquely named
temporary file in the destination directory, flushes and closes it, then uses
an atomic same-filesystem rename.

Each shard may append diagnostic events only to its own single-writer event
file. `summarize` reads the immutable manifest and authoritative per-run files,
then deterministically creates `summary/ledger.jsonl`; event logs are not used
to decide completion. Resume validates the result schema, experiment ID, job
assignment, and provenance. A temporary, truncated, stale, or conflicting
record is quarantined and rerun.

Concurrent-writer tests launch at least two shards against one result root,
interrupt one write, and verify that completed run records remain parseable,
the interrupted job is rerunnable, and repeated summarization produces the
same ledger bytes.

## Error Handling

The suite must fail explicitly for:

- missing model, checkpoint, data, or dependency;
- stale current-feature inventory;
- unsupported backend/variant combinations;
- requested Qwen native state-size changes;
- identity or active-effect gate failure;
- unavailable fast-scan support for a recurrence variant;
- initial full-recomputation Qwen exact-cache calls containing padding,
  packed-segment metadata, incremental decode/cache parameters, or cross-call
  state;
- a top-surprise screen with no possible eviction or an invalid cache/block
  width;
- non-finite loss or gradients;
- OOM; and
- malformed or conflicting resume records.

Initial full-recomputation Qwen exact-cache mode accepts only
`attention_mask=None` or an all-one
`[B,T]` mask because the current native recurrence does not make padded tokens
state no-ops. Masked/padded sequences, packed inputs, position resets,
incremental decode, and nonempty cache parameters fail with distinct actionable
errors rather than being ignored.

OOM is recorded with the requested batch, sequence, model/state/cache
dimensions, dtype/device, estimated cache bytes, peak VRAM, and failing phase
(`scan`, score, selection, read, or backward). The runner does not silently
reduce the batch, sequence length, dtype, state size, cache width/block size, or
task load, because that would invalidate paired comparisons.

One failed job does not corrupt other shards. Summaries distinguish failed,
missing, inconclusive, and completed runs.

## Verification

Implementation is complete only when all of the following are demonstrated
fresh:

1. `preflight --backend tiny` passes on CPU with only tiny requirements.
2. The tiny recurrence matches the production native reference scan in forward
   and backward tests at declared tolerances.
3. The suite-owned installer applies the unmodified upgrade manager, consumes
   every declared native-checkpoint tensor, replaces only verified native layers
   through `from_native`, strictly transfers every inherited tensor/attribute,
   initializes only declared cache names, and validates unsupported top-level
   call arguments before the inherited forward. The exact-cache class subclasses
   `KMD2NativeAttn` and confines its override to the scan call boundary.
4. The inventory recognizes current convolution, rotation, shared-query
   `r_out=4`, channel decay, write offset, absence of native exact cache, and the
   inactive legacy circular residual-buffer overlap.
5. Identity-gated variants match the full baseline before training; active
   settings change their intended path with finite gradients.
6. An independent float64 token-loop oracle proves
   `score=||k||_2 ||beta_w v-beta_e m||_2=||k u^T||_F`, including zero and
   sub-epsilon keys, and proves that cache storage uses raw `v`, not `u`.
7. Exact-cache selection tests prove independent per-head top-`w`, inclusive
   `j<=t` causality, future-prefix invariance, block-boundary persistence,
   score-descending/position-descending ties, eviction, and bounded size.
8. `scan_with_update_norm()` preserves existing `scan()` output/API and matches
   the reference in state output, exact outer-update scores, selected indices, cache read,
   and gradients for q/k/v, decay, erase/write gates, `out_mix`, cache norms,
   sink, and amplitude. Tests cross `r_out=1/4`, non-one-hot mixing, block
   boundaries, and sequence lengths around both scan and cache chunks.
9. Exact-cache branch-local tests prove recurrence q/k and `y_state` are
   unchanged; fp32 compute with fp32/bf16 storage matches an oracle using the
   identical cast round-trip; gamma-one/epsilon, zero-sink, and fixed-temperature
   initializations match their equations; empty reads are finite; zero amplitude
   has a finite nonzero opening gradient; and cache parameters/optimizer state
   save and resume strictly.
10. Initial full-recomputation Qwen exact-cache mode rejects padding masks,
    packed segments, incremental decode, cross-call state, and configurations
    that cannot exercise eviction.
11. The trapezoid recurrence resets its factor carry at every declared boundary,
    exactly matches native update at `rho_head=0`, and produces a nonzero active
    effect when the carry gate is enabled.
12. True-MIMO tests prove exact native recurrence equality at `R=1`, simultaneous
    slot-permutation invariance, expected-scale normalization, and the distinct
    MIMO-rank and state-size parameter-match protocols and tolerance.
13. Every task generator is deterministic by seed and passes answer-leak,
    balance, target, and length-split checks. Structured-plus-exceptions proves
    its rule/exception strata, temporal freshness proves latest versus stale
    labels, and affine regression proves symmetric keys and no competing
    constant q/k path.
14. A short CPU tiny screening matrix completes, resumes without duplicating
    completed jobs, and produces valid JSON and CSV summaries.
15. Statistical classification exercises every mutually exclusive addition and
    reliance label using configured 95% paired intervals, protected-metric
    vetoes, direct `M11-M10-M01+M00` factorial contrasts, complete-current
    incremental contrasts, and rejected overlapping thresholds.
16. Exact-cache selector, read, capacity, and intervention screens vary one
    factor at a time, contain matched recency/reservoir/oracle controls, cause
    real eviction, and record hit/read/staleness diagnostics.
17. Qwen dry-run/preflight accepts explicit model/checkpoint/data paths and
    rejects unsupported native state-size or Option-3 streaming arms without
    loading large assets.
18. The exact-cache Qwen job expansion contains paired native, recency, and
    winning-policy heals with matched seeds/examples/budgets and mechanically
    testable Option-3 intervals for retrieval, freshness against both controls,
    CE/KL, adjacent capacities, gate opening, persistent hits, conditional read,
    and shuffled-cache dependence.
19. Two concurrent shards plus an interrupted writer leave valid atomic run
    records and produce byte-identical ledgers across repeated summarization.
20. Canonical hash sharding is invariant to JSON key order and
    `PYTHONHASHSEED`; shards are disjoint and their union equals `jobs.json`.
21. Forced OOM and malformed-input tests create typed atomic failure records and
    never silently change batch, length, dtype, state, cache, or task settings.
22. Optional CUDA tests record device, throughput, VRAM, recurrent bytes,
    storage/compute dtypes, formula-derived metadata-inclusive persistent/block
    bytes, and measured allocator bytes.
23. Tiny and Qwen upload bundles are each built twice byte-identically, reopened,
    content/hash-checked, extracted fresh, and smoke-tested without the source
    checkout; external large assets and secrets are absent.
24. The production recurrence, `KMD2NativeAttn.forward`, existing `scan()` API,
    and baseline outputs remain unchanged; only the separately named optional
    score-returning fast-scan entry point is added.
25. Existing trainer, checkpoint, data, and result artifacts are unchanged.
26. `git diff --check` passes for all suite, test, documentation, and permitted
    fast-scan instrumentation changes.
